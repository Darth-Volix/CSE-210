For this program, start the program by running Program.cs
The program will present you with a a menu of options to
choose from, and the ones to open an account are very straight-
forward. To see a submenu of options for each of the account
types, select the option on the main menu to display the accounts
of that particular account type. The sub-menus for each of
the account type's are also very descriptive and straight-
forward. You can only add interest to deposit accounts on the 
1st of the month, you can only make payments on the due date 
for loans (unless you are choosing to close it and pay it in 
full), and you only have a maximum of 6 savings withdrawals 
per month (which is an actual federal rule). If conditions are
not met to perform a task it will tell you why and return you 
to the menu. You can end the program by returning to the main 
menu and selecting the option to exit the program.
